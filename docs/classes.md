# Reference Manual

The reference manual for BayesicFitting contains documentation on all classes 
and on the methods pertaining to the clases. Almost all software of BayesicFitting 
is in the form of classes, Models, Fitters etc. 

All classes are listed in the navigation bar on the left. 

Each reference page contains a pink part where the class is documented. Thereafter is a 
white section where all methods and the constructor are documented.

In a Python session they are called as:

    ## import some class
    from BayesicFitting import SomeClass
    ## construct an instantiation of SomeClass
    sc = SomeClass( some, arguments )
    ## assign an attribute of the class
    a = sc.someAttribute
    ## run a method of the class
    r = sc.someMethod( more, arguments )


Documentation on classes, methods, arguments and attributes are found in this 
reference manual.
