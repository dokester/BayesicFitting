class BracketModel( Brackets ):
    """
    BracketModel provides brackets to a chain of Models.

    Its results are exactly the same as the results of the contained model.

    When the contained model is a compound model (a chain of models), the
    BracketModel make a single unit out of it. It acts as a pair of brackets
    in another chain of models. Since compound models can be joined by operations
    other than addition ( there is also subtract, multiply and divide ) brackets
    are needed to distinguish m1 * ( m2 + m3 ) from m1 * m2 + m3.

    BracketModel is automatically invoked when the Model appended to another model,
    is actually a chain of models.

    Model.Brackets is an internal class inside Model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : Model
        to be put inside of brackets
    deep : int
        container depth (only for nice printing).

    Attributes from Model
    ---------------------
        npchain, parameters, stdevs, xUnit, yUnit

    Attributes from FixedModel
    --------------------------
        npmax, fixed, parlist, mlist

    Attributes from BaseModel
    --------------------------
        npbase, ndim, priors, posIndex, nonZero, tiny, deltaP, parNames


    Examples
    --------
    Explicit use of BrackeModel

    >>> m1 = GaussModel( )
    >>> m1 += PolynomialModel( 0 )              # Gauss on a constant background
    >>> m2 = BracketModel( m1 )
    >>> m3 = SineModel( )
    >>> m3 *= m2                                # sine * ( gauss + const )
    >>> print( m3 )

    Implicit use of BrackeModel, automatically invoked when m2 is a chain

    >>> m1 = GaussModel( )
    >>> m1 += PolynomialModel( 0 )              # m1 is a chain of models
    >>> m3 = SineModel( )
    >>> m3 *= m1                                # sine * ( gauss + const )
    >>> print( m3 )                             # exactly the same


    Warning
    -------
    BracketModel is about rather advanced model building.

    Notes
    -----
    1. You have to complete the BracketModel, including parameter reduction,
       BEFORE you put it into a model chain.
    2. If you change a BracketModel which is part of a model chain, unexpected result
       might happen.
