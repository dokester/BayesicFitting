class SincModel( KernelModel ):
    """
    Sinc Model.
    Also known as Cardinal Sine.

        f( x:p ) = p_0 * sin( ( x - p_1 ) / p_2 ) / ( ( x - p_1 ) / p_2 )

     where
        p_0 = amplitude
        p_1 = offset
        p_2 = width ( =Distance between first zero-crossings divided by 2 Pi. )
    As always x = input.

    The parameters are initialized at [1.0, 0.0, 1.0].

    Parameter 2 ( width ) is always kept positive ( >=0 ).

     SincModel() is syntactic sugar for
        KernelModel( kernel=Sinc() )
    See @KernelModel

    Examples
    --------
    >>> sinc = SincModel( )
    >>> print sinc.npchain
    >>> 3
    >>> print( sinc( numpy.arange( 15, dtype=float )-7 ) )        # sinc function between [-7,+7]
    >>> [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
