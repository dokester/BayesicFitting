class EvidenceProblem( ClassicProblem ):
    """
    An EvidenceProblem is a ClassicProblem containing a Dynamic and/or Modifiable
    model, where the (Gauss-approximated) evidence is used as likelihood

    Problems can be solved by NestedSampler, with appropriate Engines and
    ErrorDistributions.

    The result of the function for certain x and p is given by
    problem.result( x, p )
    The parameters, p, are to be optimized while the x provide additional
    information.
