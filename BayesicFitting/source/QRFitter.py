class QRFitter( BaseFitter ):
    """
    Fitter for linear models, using QR decomposition.
    The QRFitter class is to be used in conjunction with Model classes, linear
    in its parameters.

    For Linear models the matrix equation

        H * p = &beta;

    is solved for p. H is the Hessian matrix ( D * w * D^T )
    and &beta; is the inproduct of the data with the D, design matrix.

        &beta; = y * w * D^T

    The QRFitter class use QR decomposition which effectively is an inversion
    of the hessian matrix such that

        p = &beta; * inverse( H )

    It can be more efficient if
    similar ydata needs to be fitter to the same model and xdata.
    In that case it uses the same decomposition for all fits.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # assume x and y are numpy.asarray data arrays:
    >>> x = numpy.asarray.range( 100 )
    >>> poly = PolynomialModel( 1 )                             # line
    >>> fitter = QRFitter( x, poly )
    >>> for k in range( 1, 4 ) :
    >>>     y = numpy.arange( 100 ) // k                        # digitization noise
    >>>     param = fitter.fit( y )                             # use same QR decomposition
    >>>     stdev = fitter.stdevs                               # stdevs on the parameters
    >>>     print( k, param )
    >>>     print( " ", stdev )

    Attributes
    ----------
    needsNewDecomposition : bool
        True when starting. Thereafter False,
            i.e. the previous QR-decomposition is used, unless weights are used.
            Only for linear fitters, setting it to false might improve efficiency.
            It only works properly when the model, the x-data etc are exactly the
            same in the previous run.
            Whenever weights are used, it always needs a new decomposition.

    qrmat : matrix
        matrix formed by q * inverse( r ), where q,r is the QR decomposition
        of the design matrix.
        qrmat is to be multiplied with the data vector to get the solution.

        Create a new Fitter, providing xdatas and model.

        A Fitter class is defined by its model and the input vector (the
        independent variable). When a fit to another model and/or another
        input vector is needed a new object should be created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        xdata : array_like
            array of independent input values
        model : Model
            the model function to be fitted
        map : bool (False)
            When true, the xdata should be interpreted as a map.
            The fitting is done on the pixel indices of the map,
