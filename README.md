# Readme.

BayesicFitting is a package for model fitting and Bayesian evidence calculation.

In case you are wondering what that is about take a quick look at 
the examples in the side bars.

We have a paper out in "Astronomy and Computing" about BayesicFitting.

<a name="history"></a>
## 1. History 

The BayesicFitting package is a python version of the the fitter classes
in Herschel Common Science System (HCSS). HCSS was the all encompassing
software system for the operations and analysis of the ESA satelite 
Herschel. The HCSS version of the fitting software was written
in JAVA, mostly by me. I encoded features and classes that were requested
by my Herschel colleagues or that I remembered having used myself during
my lifelong career as data analyst for earlier satellites as IRAS, ISO
and AKARI. So most of the stuff in here was needed and used at a certain
moment in time. Later, the package was developing in directions that
were needed by my work for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). 

The HCSS system is in the public domain under GPL3. It was used by the 3
instrument groups of the Herschel satellite to write calibration and
analysis software. Since the end of the mission HCSS is not being
maintained

I used a customized version of java2python (j2py on github) to translate
the JAVA classes to python. However, the actual code needed serious
pythonization. Every line has been inspected. Every construct has been 
revised.

The documentation got most profit from the automated conversion. Also
the structure into classes, the inheritance, methods and dependencies
are largely the same as in the original HCSS.

<a name="setup"> </a>
## 2. Setup 

The package is written in python3 although I am not aware of using any
specific python3 features. It uses numpy (>= 1.9) for its array
structure, scipy (>=1.0) for linear algebra and other stuff and astropy
(>=2.0) for units. Matplotlib (>=2.0) is used for plotting.

Download and unpack the BayesicFitting zip file from github. Move into 
the BayesicFitting-master directory and run:

    python setup.py install

where python is python3. Or install it as :

    pip install BayesicFitting

<a name="structure"> </a>
## 3. Structure 

### source

The BayesicFitting package consists of over 100 classes, each class in
its own file. These classes can be divided into 3 broad categories:
models, fitters and nested sampling. About 50 models, 10 fitters and the
remainder is needed to run the nested sampling algorithm. All these
classes are in a directory [BayesicFitting/source][srclink]. 
A special type of functions are found in [BayesicFitting/source/kernels][kllink]. 
They can be used to construct a model.


### examples

In [BayesicFitting/examples][exlink] a number of scripts can be
found to exercise the classes. They are in the form of jupyter
notebooks. Some are using real data; others have synthetic data
specially constructed to make some point. 

All examples can be inspected by clicking on them. They will fold out in
the browser.

To actually exercise the examples and maybe adapt then, start a jupyter
notebook in your examples directory.

    jupyter notebook

The program will open a list in your webbrowser where you can select a
notebook file (.ipynb), which can be run.


### documentation

In the [documenation](./docs)
directory a number of documents can be found. 

+ [Manual](./docs/manual.md):
The manual for the package.

+ [Troubles](./docs/troubles.md):
A list of troublesome situations and what to do about it.

+ [Glossary](./docs/glossary.md):
A list of the terms used throughout this package, with explanations.

+ [Design](./docs/design.md):
An architectural design document, displaying the relationships between 
the classes. 

+ [Style](./docs/convention.md):
A few notes on my style of code and documenation.

+ [References](./docs/references.md):
A list of external references for BayesicFitting.

### test

Almost all classes have a test harness. These are located in
BayesicFitting/test. They can be execised as:

    python -m unittest <file>

where python refers to python3 and file refers to one of the files in
BayesicFitting/test.<br>
As most functionality is tested in a test harness, examples on how to
use the classes can be found there too.

<a name="status"> </a> 
## 4. Status 

A package like this is never finished. Always more classes and/or
functionalities can be added. I present it now as it is in the hope it
will be usefull and it will generate feedback.

According to Wikipedia -> "Software release life cycle" it is called 
"Perpetual Beta". It continues to be in a beta-release because new 
classes and features can be added.

Some of the newer additions will be indicated as having and "Alpha" 
status and keep that until they matured somewhat further. 
These classes are more prone to change in their interfaces, methods etc.

More work needs to be done in:

  * Introduction of more Classes: NeuralNetModel, Evolving Models, Filters (maybe) ...

   * Introduction of Problem Classes: 
     - Problem. <br>
	Base class for problems to be handled by NestedSampler.
     - ClassicProblem. <br>
	Common class for everything that was possible in version 1.
	ClassicProblem is transparant as all interfaces to NestedSampler have remained 
	the same as they were in version 1.0, even though behind the scenes a 
	ClassicProblem has been invoked.
     - ErrorsInXandYProblem. <br>
	Problem that have errors in the xdata  and in the ydata.
     - ... more to come.

     in NestedSampler.

     Consequently ErrorDistribution has a new initialisation, which is incompatible 
     with previous versions. In most cases this has no effect on the calling 
     sequences of NestedSampler.

   * The new class, PhantomCollection is part of NestedSampler. It contains a sorted 
     WalkerList, in which all valid positions are collected, proper walkers 
     and phantoms. Each iteration the phantoms with log likelihood lower than the 
     low limit for that iteration, are removed. The PhantomCollection is used 
     to get a better estimate on the size of the bounding box for the  walkers and
     to obtain starting positions for new walkers. In general the PhantomCollection 
     contains an order of magnitude more items than the WalkerList itself.
